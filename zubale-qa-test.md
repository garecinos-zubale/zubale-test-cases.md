## Mobile 20min QA execution plan

### Objective

Create a small QA execution plan using the following requirements:

- Scope of the test
- Types of Test
- Processes
- Test equipment
- Tools
- Environments for the execution of tests
- Sequence of tasks and work plan
  - Dates

### Case

It is a system that is in charge of managing tasks of the different brands with which we work. 
These tasks change depending on the type, time and price, which are worked by the zubaleros using a mobile app.

It is necessary to test the happy paths in an automated way to ensure that with new changes the experience of the zubalero is not breaking and that they can carry out their tasks successfully.
